        I specialize in React and the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB,
        Express, React, and Node. With years of experience in software
        development, I have honed my expertise in creating dynamic and
        responsive web applications using these technologies. In my current role
        with a startup company, I am working in a small team to develop a React
        project from scratch, which allowed me to enhance my knowledge of the
        React ecosystem and JavaScript. I am passionate about building
        innovative and efficient applications that meet the specific needs of my
        clients. I have a proven track record of developing top-quality web
        applications and managing projects from conception to launch. My
        technical proficiency, combined with my ability to work effectively in a
        team, enables me to create solutions that are scalable, secure, and
        high-performing. I am always learning and expanding my knowledge of new
        technologies and industry best practices. If you're looking for a
        skilled and motivated developer with experience in the MERN stack and
        full-stack development, I am the right person for the job. <br />
        Technology Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, React-Router,
